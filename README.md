# jaaTube-Clone-Project

Welcome To Jalal, Aisha, and Alexander's youtube clone project called JAATUBE!!!!. JAA stands for thew first inital of each of our names hence JAA LOL.

All jokes aside, we have biuilt a fully functional youtube reeact App that consumes data from youtubes public API to function as youtube does!

In this app we are able to

1-View a selection of random videos on page load
2-Use our JAATUBE search bar to search for a new selection of videos.
3-Click on a videos information to be taken to a videos respective show page, where the video/image can be viewed (on its own) abd where you can also comment on a particular video.
4-We also included an about page that has information and a link to each collaborators respective Github page.;

We spent much time and effort working on this App, so we do hope you enjoy the App as well as its functionality, and that you remain patient with any bugs you may encounter along the way

Collaborators: Alexander Tsiklidis, Aisha Kleemoff, Jalal Jonaid

Deployed on Netlify (https://gregarious-rolypoly-0a79cc.netlify.app)
